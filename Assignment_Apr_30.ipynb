It is sensitive to outliers, as outliers can distort the calculation of cluster compactness and separation. The index does not take into account the shape and density of clusters, focusing only on distances and centroids. To overcome these limitations, alternative clustering evaluation metrics can be used, such as silhouette-based measures or other indices designed to handle specific clustering scenarios. Additionally, it is important to consider multiple evaluation metrics and interpret the results in conjunction with domain knowledge and visual inspection to gain a comprehensive understanding of the clustering quality"
