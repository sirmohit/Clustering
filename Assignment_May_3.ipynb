    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection by identifying the most relevant features that contribute to distinguishing between normal and anomalous instances. Effective feature selection can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection algorithms by reducing the dimensionality of the data, removing irrelevant or redundant features, and improving the interpretability of the results. It helps to focus on the most informative aspects of the data, enabling better discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns."

    "The algorithm starts with an arbitrary instance and identifies its neighborhood within a specified distance (epsilon) using a distance metric.\n",
